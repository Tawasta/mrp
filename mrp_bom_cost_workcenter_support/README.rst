===============================
BOM Workcenter Cost Calculation
===============================

* Shows the cost of BOM based on its workcenters' costs
* Shows also the total cost when combined with BOM's component costs

Configuration
=============
\-

Usage
=====
* Open a BOM form view to see its operation costs
* The operation costs are calculated on the fly
* Total costs also contain the component costs from mrp_bom_cost module

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
* Testing with large BOMs should still be done. If loading times do not become an issue, mrp_bom_cost should be modified to use this kind of on-the-fly calculation as well
